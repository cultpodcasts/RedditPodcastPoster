# V2 Services Migration Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the creation of V2 service variants that work with detached episodes via `IEpisodeRepository` instead of the embedded `podcast.Episodes` collection.

## Completed V2 Services

### ✅ Core Episode Services

**1. IPodcastEpisodeFilterV2 / PodcastEpisodeFilterV2**
- Location: `Class-Libraries\RedditPodcastPoster.Common\Episodes\`
- Purpose: Filters episodes from detached `IEpisodeRepository`
- Key Methods:
  - `GetNewEpisodesReleasedSince()` - Episodes ready to post
  - `GetMostRecentUntweetedEpisodes()` - Episodes needing tweets
  - `GetMostRecentBlueskyReadyEpisodes()` - Episodes ready for Bluesky
  - `IsRecentlyExpiredDelayedPublishing()` - Delayed publishing check
- Dependencies: `IPodcastRepositoryV2`, `IEpisodeRepository`
- Converts V2 models to legacy for compatibility

**2. IPodcastEpisodeProviderV2 / PodcastEpisodeProviderV2**
- Location: `Class-Libraries\RedditPodcastPoster.Common\Episodes\`
- Purpose: Provides podcast episodes across all podcasts
- Key Methods:
  - `GetUntweetedPodcastEpisodes()` - All untweeted episodes
  - `GetUntweetedPodcastEpisodes(Guid)` - For specific podcast
  - `GetBlueskyReadyPodcastEpisodes()` - All Bluesky-ready
  - `GetBlueskyReadyPodcastEpisodes(Guid)` - For specific podcast
- Dependencies: `IPodcastRepositoryV2`, `IPodcastEpisodeFilterV2`
- Uses V2 filter for episode retrieval

**3. IPodcastEpisodePosterV2 / PodcastEpisodePosterV2**
- Location: `Class-Libraries\RedditPodcastPoster.Common\Episodes\`
- Purpose: Posts podcast episodes and updates posted status in detached repository
- Key Methods:
  - `PostPodcastEpisode()` - Posts episode(s) and marks as posted
- Features:
  - Supports bundled episodes using title regex
  - Loads episodes from detached repository for bundling
  - Updates episode `Posted` status via `IEpisodeRepository`
- Dependencies: `IEpisodePostManager`, `IPostModelFactory`, `IEpisodeRepository`

**4. IPodcastFilterV2 / PodcastFilterV2**
- Location: `Class-Libraries\RedditPodcastPoster.Common\Podcasts\`
- Purpose: Filters episodes based on elimination terms
- Key Methods:
  - `Filter()` - Filters episodes and marks matching ones as removed
- Features:
  - Checks episode titles and descriptions against elimination terms
  - Updates episode `Removed` status via `IEpisodeRepository`
  - Returns `FilterResult` with filtered episodes
- Dependencies: `IPodcastRepositoryV2`, `IEpisodeRepository`

### ✅ Infrastructure Services (from previous session)

**5. IEpisodeMerger / EpisodeMerger**
- Location: `Class-Libraries\RedditPodcastPoster.Persistence\`
- Purpose: Merges episodes without mutating embedded collections
- Returns `EpisodeMergeResult` with V2 episodes to save

**6. PodcastUpdaterV2**
- Location: `Class-Libraries\RedditPodcastPoster.PodcastServices\`
- Purpose: Implements `IPodcastUpdater` with V2 repositories
- Uses `IPodcastRepositoryV2` and `IEpisodeRepository`

## Registration Status

All V2 services are registered in DI:
- ✅ `IEpisodeMerger` → `EpisodeMerger` (Persistence layer)
- ✅ `IPodcastEpisodeFilterV2` → `PodcastEpisodeFilterV2` (Common layer)
- ✅ `IPodcastEpisodeProviderV2` → `PodcastEpisodeProviderV2` (Common layer)
- ✅ `IPodcastEpisodePosterV2` → `PodcastEpisodePosterV2` (Common layer)
- ✅ `IPodcastFilterV2` → `PodcastFilterV2` (Common layer)
- ✅ `PodcastUpdaterV2` (PodcastServices layer - not yet registered as replacement)

## Migration Strategy

### Current State: Dual-Track Support
- ✅ Legacy services (`IPodcastEpisodeFilter`, `IPodcastEpisodeProvider`) still registered
- ✅ V2 services registered alongside legacy
- ✅ Consumers can choose which version to use

### Next Steps

**Phase 1: Migrate Consumers**
1. Update console apps to use V2 providers
2. Update API handlers to use V2 providers
3. Test each consumer independently

**Phase 2: Additional V2 Services Needed**
1. `IPodcastEpisodePosterV2` - for bundled episode posting
2. `IPodcastFilterV2` - for elimination terms filtering
3. URL submission services V2

**Phase 3: Deprecation**
1. Mark legacy services as `[Obsolete]`
2. Remove legacy services after all consumers migrated
3. Remove `Podcast.Episodes` property

## V2 Service Design Pattern

All V2 services follow this pattern:

```csharp
public class ServiceV2(
    IPodcastRepositoryV2 podcastRepository,
    IEpisodeRepository episodeRepository,
    // other deps
) : IServiceV2
{
    public async Task<Result> MethodAsync(Guid podcastId)
    {
        // 1. Load V2 podcast
        var v2Podcast = await podcastRepository.GetBy(x => x.Id == podcastId);
        
        // 2. Load detached episodes
        var v2Episodes = await episodeRepository.GetByPodcastId(podcastId).ToListAsync();
        
        // 3. Convert to legacy for compatibility with existing logic
        var legacyPodcast = ToLegacyPodcast(v2Podcast, legacyEpisodes);
        var legacyEpisodes = v2Episodes.Select(ToLegacyEpisode).ToList();
        
        // 4. Perform operations
        // ...
        
        // 5. Save changes via V2 repositories
        await episodeRepository.Save(updatedEpisodes);
        await podcastRepository.Save(v2Podcast);
    }
    
    private static Episode ToLegacyEpisode(Models.V2.Episode v2) { /* ... */ }
    private static Podcast ToLegacyPodcast(Models.V2.Podcast v2, List<Episode> episodes) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Key Benefits
- ✅ Works with detached episodes
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing logic
- ✅ Can be tested independently
- ✅ Gradual migration path
- ✅ Legacy and V2 coexist safely

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test V2 services with mocked repositories
- Verify conversion methods work correctly
- Test edge cases (no episodes, removed podcasts, etc.)

### Integration Testing
- Test V2 services against real Cosmos DB (dev environment)
- Compare results with legacy services
- Verify episode filtering logic matches

### Consumer Testing
- Update one consumer at a time
- Run smoke tests after each migration
- Compare output with legacy implementation

## Known Limitations

### Temporary Limitations
1. V2 services still use legacy `Podcast` and `Episode` models internally for compatibility
2. Some logic duplication between legacy and V2 implementations
3. Conversion overhead from V2 to legacy models

### Future Improvements
1. Refactor internal logic to work directly with V2 models
2. Extract shared filtering logic into common utilities
3. Remove conversion methods once legacy removed

## Build Status
✅ **All code compiles successfully**
✅ **Zero build errors**
✅ **All V2 services registered in DI**

## Completed Migrations

### Console Processors
- ✅ `AddAudioPodcastProcessor` - uses `PodcastUpdaterV2`
- ✅ `EnrichYouTubePodcastProcessor` - uses `IEpisodeRepository` directly

### Ready for V2 Provider Migration
These consumers can now be updated to use V2 providers:
- `Console-Apps/Tweet/TweetProcessor.cs`
- `Console-Apps/Poster/PostProcessor.cs`
- API handlers using `IPodcastEpisodeProvider`

## Next Session Tasks

1. **Migrate Tweet/Post consumers** to use `IPodcastEpisodeProviderV2`
2. **Create `IPodcastEpisodePosterV2`** for bundled episode posting
3. **Migrate URL submission services** to V2
4. **Update API handlers** to use V2 providers
5. **Add comprehensive tests** for V2 services
