# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- User prefers minimizing search-index payload by storing compact identifiers (YouTube/Spotify/Apple IDs) and reduced key names, with UI reconstructing URLs.
- User prefers using the term `CompactSearchRecord` and avoiding `V2` terminology in migration planning and schema naming.
- User does not want additional Episode members for compact IDs; use existing Spotify/YouTube/Apple IDs and derive Apple episode slug from Apple URL via regex.

## Container Creation
- User prefers explicit container factory methods `CreatePodcastsContainer()` and `CreateEpisodesContainer()` instead of `Create(string containerName)`.
